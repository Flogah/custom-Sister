This contains the model and texture to pose and accessorize battle sister troops.

To use in tts, export as .obj and attach the texture. Don't upload the texture more than once, you can simply copy/paste the texture link between models.

You can find a bunch of uploaded models under https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2658210691
